# AD Exploitation Training
This is a collection of small services to train exploit development. In addition to this you will need some iptables magic to DNAT some private IP addresses to the corresponding ports to make it feel like there are actually multiple other teams with an identical setup.

## Deployment
An example deployment script looks as follows (untested):
```
#!/bin/sh

export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common git
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | apt-key add -
add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-compose

git clone https://github.com/ldruschk/ad_exploitation_training.git
cd ad_exploitation_training
cat << EOF
SECRET_KEY=set_something_here_which_you_do_not_share
SERVICE_COUNT=1

SERVICE_00_FLAG=enotraining{place_this_flag_in_CTFd}
SERVICE_00_THRESHOLD=1
EOF > config.env
docker-compose up -d
```
